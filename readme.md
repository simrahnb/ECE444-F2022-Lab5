User Story 2: As a first-year student, I would like courses to display possible careers & fields that they can lead to. As part of this, I would also like to see any and all prerequisites.

User Story 3: As a student who lives downtown & studies engineering, I want to only see courses that are offered by the faculty of engineering and that are available on the main campus.
